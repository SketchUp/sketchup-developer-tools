# Welcome to SketchUp Developer Tools

A SketchUp Ruby Extension that provides some tools to make developers' lives
easier, including a better, badder Ruby console and a unit test runner we
affectionately call "TestUp."

More tools to come. Want to contribute? Please do!

## Installing

The latest and greatest (definitely still in beta) is available as an RBZ.
Download the file from this url:

https://github.com/SketchUp/sketchup-developer-tools/raw/master/sketchup-developer-tools-0.0.1.rbz

Then inside SketchUp, select Preferences > Extensions > Install Extension and select the RBZ file you just downloaded. Voila! SketchUp installs the extension.
You'll find a new menu under Tools > Developer with all the goodies.

## Contributing

If you're a SketchUp Ruby community member, use git to grab the code, make some changes, then send us a pull request. (If you don't know what that is, that's okay, we barely know ourselves. Go google some github tutorials and give it a try. Please improve our README.md file with better instructions!)

If you're an owner of this repo, here are some steps.

Get a local copy of the files. This will create a sketchup-stl folder.

	git clone https://github.com/SketchUp/sketchup-developer-tools.git  
	cd sketchup-developer-tools 

Use your favorite editor to edit README.md. Then...

	git add README.md                     // Marks README.md for edit.  
	git commit -m "Editing our README"    // Records changes in the local branch.  
	git push                              // Submits to repository. Yay!
