<h2>Functional Tests</h2>
If you have complex functional tests (i.e. ones that test multiple
systems at once, load a bunch of assets, or take a long time to run),
this is the directory to place them. Tests in this folder should never fail.

<p>The code in this folder contains great examples of how to build complex
tests that load stuff from disk, etc.

<p>
  <input checked type="checkbox" onclick="for (var i=0; i < document.getElementsByTagName('INPUT').length; i++) {document.getElementsByTagName('INPUT')[i].checked = this.checked;}">
  <b>Check/Uncheck all</b><br>
</p>
