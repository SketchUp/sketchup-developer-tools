# The Developer Console is a command-line interface to Ruby and JavaScript.
# Major goals of the console are multi-line input, reloading of scripts
# without requiring a SketchUp restart, and a high level of control over 
# output processing. This latter aspect includes being able to turn off
# console output during performance-sensitive operations, being able to
# write the console output to a log file, altering font size, etc.

# The Console ruby class acts as a form of "server" which responds to any

# these requests are those that evaluate Ruby input from the user and those
