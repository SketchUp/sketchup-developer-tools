<h2>Ruby Class Unit Tests</h2>
These are simple unit tests of the API's core classes. Note that by checking them
all and running them, you can see the percentage of the API that is covered
by unit tests. Please submit your tests to help us reach 100%!

<p>Note that some of these tests require user interaction. If you're asked to save files, etc.? Just Say No. 

<p><b>WARNING:</b> The TC_UI test will open every toolbar and dialog! So be
prepared to do a little manual closing.

<P><input checked type="checkbox" onclick="for (var i=0; i < document.getElementsByTagName('INPUT').length; i++) {document.getElementsByTagName('INPUT')[i].checked = this.checked;}"><b>Check/Uncheck all</b><br>
